# Hackathon

## Description

Your task is to implement methods that work with strings and arrays.

## Getting Started

Download the Template project and push it to your Buddy Group GitLab Repository. Then add your method implementations to ***`ArrayHelpers.cs`*** and ***`StringHelpers.cs`***.

## Requirements

- You can create new methods, but **do not** modify the existing ones.
- Each member **must** implement at least four methods.
- Each member **must** be able to explain how their code works. 
- Each member **must** be able to explain how the entire project works and why it was implemented that way.
- Each method **must** have a documentation that contains the following sections:
    - _Description_ - A short summary of what the method is supposed to do.
    - _Parameters_ - The name and type of the method's arguments. 
    - _Returns_ - The type of the returned value, if applicable; otherwise use `void`.
    - _Author_ - Who implemented the method.

### Documentation Example

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Concatenates two strings and returns a new string.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="string1">The left part of the new string</param>
/// <param name="string2">The right part of the new string</param>
/// <returns>A string that represents the concatenation of string1's characters followed by string2's characters.</returns>
/// <author>Kiril Stanoev</author>
public static string Concat(string string1, string string2)
{
  // Add your implementation here
}
```

## Constraints
- Do not use any of the [string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netcore-3.1#methods) or [Array](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array?view=netcore-3.1#methods) built in methods.

## Hints
- Reusing code is great. If you see an opportunity, do it!

Good luck!
